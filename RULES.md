# Scrimmer of the Hill - Rules & Logic

## Overview
This bot tracks "King of the Hill" style scrimmage competitions where players compete to become and remain the king through consecutive wins.

## Core Game Rules

### Becoming King
- When **no king exists**, the winner of any game becomes the new king with a streak of 1
- When a **non-king defeats the current king**, they take the crown and start a new streak of 1
- The king role is automatically assigned/removed via Discord roles

### Defending the Crown
- When the **king wins against any player**, their streak increases by 1
- The king maintains their role and continues their streak
- Best streaks are tracked for leaderboard ranking

### Non-King Games
- Games between two non-king players **do not affect** king status or streaks
- These results do not need to be tracked but don't contribute to the leaderboard
- Only games involving the current king matter for streak tracking OR if there is no current king and the game results in the new king being crowned

### King Expiration
- If no games are played for **3 days**, the king is automatically dethroned
- The throne becomes vacant and the next winner becomes the new king
- Expired kings lose their role but their best streak is preserved

## Result Tracking

### Message Format
Results must be posted in the `#scrimmage-results` channel in this format:
```
@Player1 X-Y @Player2 (EGO)
```
Where:
- `@Player1` and `@Player2` are Discord user mentions
- `X-Y` is the score (higher score wins)
- `EGO` can be a single number (same ego for both) or `EGO1/EGO2` format
- Ties (X=Y) are ignored

### Ego Tracking

#### Current King's Ego Floor
- When a player becomes king, their ego at that moment becomes the **starting ego floor** for that streak
- As the king defends their crown, their **ego floor** is tracked as the **minimum ego** across all wins in that streak
- If the king wins with a lower ego than their current floor, the floor is updated to that lower value
- The ego floor represents the lowest difficulty level at which the king maintained their streak

#### Best Streak Ego
- Each player's **best historical streak** is associated with the **ego floor** from that specific streak
- When a player achieves a new personal best streak, the ego floor from that streak is saved
- If a player is on a different (non-record) streak, that streak's ego is only tracked internally
- The leaderboard displays ego values for both:
  1. **Current King Section**: Shows the active king's current streak and ego floor
  2. **Best Streaks Section**: Shows all-time best streaks with their associated ego floors

#### Example Scenarios
- Player becomes king at ego 90, defends at 88, then 92, then 85 ‚Üí Ego floor = 85
- Player achieves 10-win streak (ego floor 85), later gets 8-win streak (ego floor 90) ‚Üí Leaderboard shows 10 wins with ego 85
- Current king with 5-win streak (ego floor 92) appears on leaderboard with ego 92 next to crown üëë

### Multiple Results
- Multiple results can be posted in a single message (one per line)
- Each result is processed independently in order

## Edit Handling Logic

### Three Edit Scenarios

#### 1. Ego Change Only
**Scenario**: User fixes a typo in ego values (e.g., `(80/90)` ‚Üí `(80/95)`)

**Behavior**:
- **No changes occur** - ego edits on existing results are ignored
- The original ego values used when the game was first processed remain
- Message is marked as reprocessed with updated content hash
- This prevents retroactive changes to historical ego floors

**Rationale**: Ego floors represent the actual difficulty at the time of play. Allowing retroactive changes would invalidate streak achievements.

**Log Output**: `"Reprocessing EXISTING result: Winner=X (ego Y)"`

#### 2. Winner Change
**Scenario**: User corrects the score, changing who won (e.g., `5-3` ‚Üí `3-5`)

**Behavior**:
- If the message is **recent** (last 5 messages in channel):
  - Winner change is detected
  - Bot fetches last 5 messages and recalculates streaks from them **starting fresh**
  - Assumes no king existed before these 5 messages (streak starts at 0)
  - King role and current streak are updated based on recalculated history
  - **Best streaks are preserved** (never decreased)
  - Log: `"Winner changed in recent message - recalculating from last 5 messages"`
  
- If the message is **old** (beyond last 5 messages):
  - Winner change is detected
  - Edit is **ignored** (treated as already processed)
  - Log: `"Winner changed in old message - ignoring edit, beyond threshold"`

**Important Limitation**: 
- Recalculation treats the last 5 messages as a fresh start
- If someone had a long streak before those 5 messages, that context is lost during recalculation
- However, their **best streak** is always preserved in the leaderboard
- Current king/streak may change, but historical achievements remain
- This trade-off keeps implementation simple while catching immediate errors

**Rationale**: 
- Recalculating only last 5 messages is cheap and fast
- Catches immediate mistakes without expensive full history processing
- Old history remains immutable for stability
- Best streaks never decrease, so historical achievements are safe

#### 3. Content Unchanged
**Scenario**: Message edited but content is identical (whitespace only, etc.)

**Behavior**:
- Content hash matches previous processing
- Message is skipped entirely
- No processing occurs

**Log Output**: `"Message already processed with same content, skipping"`

## Result Deduplication

### Result Keys
Each game result is tracked using a unique key:
```
{message_id}:{player1_id}:{player2_id}:{timestamp}
```
Where `player1_id` and `player2_id` are **sorted numerically** to ensure the same game is recognized regardless of player order.

### Stored Data
The bot maintains a dictionary mapping result keys to winner IDs:
```python
processed_results = {
    "123456:111:222:1698765432": 111,  # Player 111 won
    "123457:111:333:1698765500": 333   # Player 333 won
}
```

### Detection Logic
1. Parse edited message to extract results
2. Generate result key for each game
3. Compare current winner to stored winner_id
4. If different (and not 0), trigger full recalculation

## State Persistence

### Leaderboard Message
- Posted and pinned in `#scrimmer-of-the-hill` channel
- Contains visible leaderboard with rankings
- Embeds complete state as JSON in spoiler tags
- Updated after every game or edit

### State Data
The following data is persisted:
- `best_streaks`: Dictionary of user_id ‚Üí highest streak achieved
- `best_streak_egos`: Dictionary of user_id ‚Üí ego floor from their best streak
- `current_king_id`: User ID of current king (or null)
- `current_streak`: Current king's active streak count
- `current_king_ego_floor`: Minimum ego during current king's active streak
- `last_activity`: Timestamp of most recent game
- `processed_messages`: Dictionary of message_id ‚Üí content_hash
- `processed_results`: Dictionary of result_key ‚Üí winner_id

### Recovery on Restart
- Bot searches for pinned message in leaderboard channel
- Extracts JSON state from spoiler block
- Restores all tracked data
- Continues operation seamlessly

## Message Processing Flow

```
New/Edited Message
    ‚Üì
Is bot's own message? ‚Üí Skip
    ‚Üì
In #scrimmage-results? ‚Üí Skip if not
    ‚Üì
Calculate content hash
    ‚Üì
Already processed with same hash? ‚Üí Skip
    ‚Üì
Check if king expired (3 days) ‚Üí Dethrone if expired
    ‚Üì
Parse results from message
    ‚Üì
Check if winner changed:
    - If no: Process normally (update ego if existing result)
    - If yes AND message is recent (last 5): Recalculate from last 5 messages
    - If yes AND message is old: Log warning, skip edit
    ‚Üì
Process each result (if no winner change or after recalculation):
    - Determine winner/loser
    - Update ego values (always)
    - Check if new result
    - If new: Update streaks, assign roles
    - If existing: Skip streak updates
    ‚Üì
Mark message as processed
    ‚Üì
Update leaderboard message
```

## Leaderboard Display

### Ranking Criteria
Players are ranked by their **best streak** (highest consecutive wins as king)

### Display Format
```
üèÜ Scrim Leaderboard

**Current King** üëë
@Player1 - 5 wins (Ego: 92)

**Best Streaks**
1. @Player2 - 15 wins (Ego: 85)
2. @Player1 - 12 wins (Ego: 88)
3. @Player3 - 8 wins (Ego: 90)
...

Last game: 5 minutes ago
King expires: in 2 days

||```json
{state data}
```||
```

### Display Sections
- **Current King**: Shown at the top if a king exists, displays their active streak and current ego floor
- **Best Streaks**: Ranked list of all-time best streaks with their historical ego floors
- The current king may appear in both sections if their current streak is also their best

## Error Handling

### Missing Members
- If a mentioned user is not found in the guild, the result is skipped
- Error logged: `"Could not find members (winner=X, loser=Y)"`

### Permission Errors
- If bot lacks permission to assign/remove roles, operation is skipped
- Error logged: `"Bot lacks permission to..."`
- Game is still tracked, role assignment retried on next result

### Invalid Messages
- Messages that don't match the result pattern are ignored
- No error logged (silent skip)
- Bot only processes valid result formats

## Technical Notes

### Timezone Handling
- All timestamps stored as UTC
- Message `created_at` used for game timestamp (not processing time)
- Ensures chronological ordering during recalculation

### Memory Management
- `processed_messages` and `processed_results` only track last 5 messages
- When processing new results, old unneeded entries are pruned
- Minimal memory footprint - typically 5-10 tracked results
- During recalculation, historical streak context is discarded (starts fresh)
- Best streaks are never pruned or decreased

### Performance Considerations
- Winner-change edits on recent messages trigger limited recalculation (last 5 messages only)
- Winner-change edits on old messages are ignored (history locked beyond threshold)
- Ego-only edits are fast (no recalculation needed)
- Recalculation is bounded and predictable (max 5 messages)
